### Welcome to my Personal Portfolio Website!

This is a simple portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my skills, projects, and experiences.


### Features/ideas I want to incorporate
- Keep track of count of users that click and view website (maybe further implement for each page/project/etc.)
- dark and light mode switch (implement further with an intuitive 'lightbulb' at the top?) 
- create/add personal logo/logos 
- pages for more responsive and cool things (animation following mouse?)
  - interactive spider web
  - interactive lightning
  - interactive electric tentacles
  - simple interective pixie dusk cursor for less distraction
- AI integration
- 'ME' cartoon/AI logo 'reacting' differently according to different actions/clicks
- glowing icons/buttons?
- when swiping up (going down webpage), trigger video animation at the top (hand pulling page?)
- looping animations?
- improve text (shadow, glow, etc.)
- make personal logo in nav bar for hero section
- timeline for projects?
- incorporate diff sections, not just projects?
